# Library Management System

## Overview
Welcome to the **Library Management System**! ðŸ“šâœ¨  
This system is designed to track **books**, **authors**, **patrons**, and **book loans** in a library. Using MySQL as the database backend, the system allows for operations like adding new books, registering patrons, and keeping track of which books are borrowed by which patrons.

## Database Structure
The system is built around four primary tables:

- **authors** â€“ Stores information about book authors.
- **books** â€“ Stores details about the books available in the library.
- **patrons** â€“ Stores details about the library patrons.
- **loans** â€“ Tracks which books have been borrowed and when.

### Tables and Relationships
#### `authors` table
Stores details about authors:

- `author_id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (Author's name)
- `birthdate` (Date of birth)
- `nationality` (Author's nationality)

#### `books` table
Stores details about books:

- `book_id` (Primary Key)
- `title` (Book title)
- `genre` (Book genre)
- `publication_date` (Date the book was published)
- `author_id` (Foreign Key to `authors` table)

#### `patrons` table
Stores patron details:

- `patron_id` (Primary Key)
- `first_name` (Patron's first name)
- `last_name` (Patron's last name)
- `email` (Patron's email, unique)
- `phone_number` (Patron's phone number)
- `registration_date` (Date the patron registered)

#### `loans` table
Tracks book loans:

- `loan_id` (Primary Key)
- `patron_id` (Foreign Key to `patrons` table)
- `book_id` (Foreign Key to `books` table)
- `loan_date` (Date the book was borrowed)
- `return_date` (Date the book was returned)

### Relationships
- **One-to-Many (1:M):**
  - One author can write many books (`authors` to `books`).
  - One patron can borrow many books (`patrons` to `loans`).

- **Many-to-Many (M:M):**
  - A patron can borrow multiple books, and a book can be borrowed by multiple patrons over time. This relationship is captured in the `loans` table.

### ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
Here's an overview of how the database tables are related:

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the Library Management System, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository or download the SQL file.

### 2. **Create the database**:

You can execute the provided SQL script in MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or any other MySQL client to create the necessary tables and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;
USE LibraryDB;
````

### 3. **Create the tables**:

Run the provided SQL script to create the tables and relationships.

### 4. **Insert sample data (Optional)**:

After creating the tables, you can run the sample insert statements in the script to populate the database with sample data for authors, books, patrons, and loans.

### 5. **Access the database**:

Use MySQL client tools or write SQL queries to interact with the database. Examples of interactions include adding new books, registering patrons, and tracking loans.

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries to get started:

* **Get all books by a specific author:**

```sql
SELECT b.title 
FROM books b
JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE a.name = 'J.K. Rowling';
```

* **Get all books borrowed by a specific patron:**

```sql
SELECT b.title, l.loan_date 
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN patrons p ON l.patron_id = p.patron_id
WHERE p.first_name = 'John' AND p.last_name = 'Doe';
```

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we could enhance the system with the following features:

* Implement a **due date** for each loan and calculate overdue books.
* Add a **fine** for overdue books and track fines for patrons.
* Implement **user authentication** for both patrons and librarians.

### Changes Made:
1. **Images:** Placeholder images for "Library" and the **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.
   - Replace the placeholder URLs (`https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Library+Management+System`) with actual images of your system or diagrams.
   
2. **Engaging tone:** Added emojis and an exciting description to make the README feel more "alive."
   
3. **Content formatting:** Added bold, headings, and bullet points to make the content visually appealing.

Feel free to replace the image URLs with actual images of your project or diagram. Let me know if you need help with creating or uploading diagrams!
